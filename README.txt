# Getting and Cleaning Data – Course Project

## Project Description
This project is part of the Coursera course **Getting and Cleaning Data**.
The goal is to prepare a tidy dataset from the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset*.

The script `Run_analysis.r` performs all required steps to clean, merge, and summarize the data.

## Files in this Repository

- **Run_analysis.r**  
  R script that:
  1. Merges the training and test datasets.
  2. Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names.
  4. Applies descriptive variable names.
  5. Creates a second independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

- **tidy_data.txt**  
  The final tidy dataset generated by the script.

- **CodeBook.md**  
  Describes the variables, data transformations, and units.
