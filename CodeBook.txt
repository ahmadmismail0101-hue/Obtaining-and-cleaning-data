# CodeBook – Tidy Data Set

## Source Data
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset  
Collected from accelerometers and gyroscopes of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

---

## Data Processing Steps

1. Merged training and test datasets.
2. Extracted only measurements containing mean() and std().
3. Replaced activity IDs with descriptive activity names.
4. Applied descriptive variable names.
5. Created a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

## Variables

### Identifiers
- **subject**  
  Integer (1–30) identifying the participant.

- **activity**  
  Activity performed by the subject:
  - WALKING  
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
  - SITTING  
  - STANDING  
  - LAYING  

---

### Measurement Variables
All remaining variables are averages of the original measurements,
grouped by subject and activity.

Examples:
- `Time_BodyAccelerometer_mean_X`
- `Time_BodyAccelerometer_std_Y`
- `Frequency_BodyGyroscope_mean_Z`

---

## Units
- Acceleration: standard gravity units (g)
- Angular velocity: radians/second

---

## Summary Dataset
The final dataset (`tidy_data.txt`) contains:
- 180 rows (30 subjects × 6 activities)
- One column per averaged measurement variable
- One row per subject and activity combination
